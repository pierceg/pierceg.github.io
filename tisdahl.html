<h2>Diversity</h2>
<p> Keeping Evanston diverse is a primary commitment Mayor Elizabeth Tisdahl has made to the community. Tisdahl implemented NSP2, The Neighborhood Stabilization Program 2, which helps stabilize neighborhoods that have been hardest hit by the effects of foreclosed and abandoned properties. The goal of the NSP2 funding is to purchase 100 foreclosed or abandoned properties and to rehabilitate these buildings for affordable housing, either for purchase or for rental. In addition, the funds enable Evanston to redevelop local businesses and renegotiate mortgages. THe new homes, that are being built in mixed income regions, will help a diverse group of people be able to live in Evanston</p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>As part of U.S. Mayors’ Climate Protection Agreement of 2006, Tisdahl has worked to incorporate the Evanston Climate  Action Plan. Under Tisdahl, Evanston is among hundreds of cities striving to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets for carbon emission in their communities. Evanston is working toward a 7% reduction in 1990 emission levels by 2012, and Evanston has been named 2015 Fund Earth Hour City Capital by World Wildlife Fund under Tisdahl's policies</p>

<h2>Economic Development</h2>
<p>Mayor Tisdahl's goal is to attract and retain high tech and renewable energy enterprises to become part of Evanston’s economy. She is also committed to creatively expanding Evanston’s tax base, because it is the driving force behind any community. The Mayor, her staff and the Evanston City Council have all put their shoulders to the wheel. And results are in: Evanston is seeing foreclosed houses rehabbed and made available to familes. Small businesses and national chains are filling up vacant storefronts and breaking ground for new buildings. Working with Northwestern University President Morton Schapiro, Mayor Tisdahl meets with and encourages start-ups that have been incubated at Northwestern University to make Evanston their headquarters.</p>
